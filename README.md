## Story 2
<p align="center">
<p>Two adventurous women, Becky and Hunter, decide to climb an abandoned 2,000-foot TV tower in a remote desert to overcome personal fears. They ascend the towering structure, reaching the top with breathtaking views, but the rusty ladder collapses, leaving them stranded. With no way down and no cell signal, they ration their supplies and attempt to signal for help, using a drone that eventually crashes. Becky‚Äôs injuries worsen as they struggle against the elements and vulture attacks. Desperate, they send a phone inside Hunter‚Äôs shoe, dropped into a pile of debris below. In a final twist, Becky, hallucinating due to dehydration, realizes Hunter has already died, and she was imagining her survival. She climbs down using Hunter‚Äôs body as a counterweight, reaches the ground, and is finally rescued, haunted by the experience</p>
